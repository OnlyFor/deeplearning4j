# ND4J Log Analyzer

This Java project is a log analyzer for ND4J, a scientific computing library for the JVM. The project uses Maven as its build tool.

## Key Components

### InterceptorUtils

This class provides utility methods for logging operations and custom operations. It generates unique IDs for operations and arrays, and logs the inputs and outputs of operations. It also provides a method to get a stack trace.

### OpLogEvent

This class represents a log event for an operation. It contains the operation name, inputs, outputs, and a stack trace.

### Nd4jInterceptor

This class is the main entry point for the application. It uses the Byte Buddy library to intercept calls to certain classes and methods in the ND4J library. It sets up several transformers to intercept calls to `MultiLayerNetwork`, `Layer`, and `GraphVertex` classes.

## Functionality

The project intercepts calls to certain ND4J operations, logs the inputs and outputs of these operations, and then allows the operations to proceed. This can be useful for debugging and performance analysis.

The intercepted classes include:

- `MultiLayerNetwork`: A class from the DeepLearning4j library that represents a multi-layer neural network.
- `Layer`: A class from the DeepLearning4j library that represents a layer in a neural network.
- `GraphVertex`: A class from the DeepLearning4j library that represents a vertex in a computation graph.

The project uses the Byte Buddy library to perform the method interception. Byte Buddy is a code generation and manipulation library for Java.

## Usage

To use this project, you would typically include it as a Java agent when running your application. The agent will then intercept calls to the specified ND4J operations and log them.
