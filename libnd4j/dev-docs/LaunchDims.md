# libnd4j CUDA Kernel Launch Configuration

This part of the libnd4j codebase provides a centralized way to handle CUDA launch configurations. It allows customization of launch dimensions using environment variables.

## Conceptual Overview

The code sets up CUDA launch configurations for a wide range of algorithms used in the libnd4j codebase. These configurations are expressed as `dim3` structures, representing grid and block dimensions for launching CUDA kernels. The configurations are stored in a map, improving performance via a caching mechanism.

### Key Feature

A significant feature of this code is the flexibility it offers, allowing users to specify custom launch dimensions through environment variables. This enables modifications of these configurations at both compile-time and runtime.

## Examples of Usage

```cpp
// Fetching Launch Dimensions
dim3 launchDims = getLaunchDims("matrixMultiply");

// This returns a dim3 struct containing the dimensions for launching the CUDA kernel for the "matrixMultiply" algorithm.

// Using Environment Variables for Customization
// The preset configurations can be overridden using environment variables. For instance, to set custom launch dimensions for the "matrixMultiply"
